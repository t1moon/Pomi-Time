# Pomi-Time

## Description
Imagine that today you are planning to do some very important things:
> Add tasks to the "Today's tasks" list and click on any task. You will see a pomodoro timer. With each completed task you get closer to the daily goal
> After you have done for today, mark the tasks that you have completed and click on "end session"
> You will be presented with statistics for the session, where you can see how much was done for each task. All tasks that you haven't done are automatically transferred to your main task list. From that list you can transfer the task to "Today's tasks" by pressing just one button
> Preferences for work and rest time, as well as daily goal can be changed to your taste
